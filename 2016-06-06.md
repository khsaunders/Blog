Modal Tutorial

So something I recently learned how to do was to make a modal. It's a simple, little pop-up box that can prompt users for information (such as an email address to join a mailing list).

Below are the steps I took to make mine:

1) Set up the documents. For this project, we will need HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files all in one folder.

2) The HTML
Set up an HTML document the way one normally would, complete with the head tags and body tags. Something to keep in mind is that we will need to link our JavaScript document in here, so put a script tag just before the close of the body tag. Additionally, I used jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript, so I needed to include a link to that library for my HTML document.

Your script tag and library link should look something like this:

"...
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src ="card-game.js"></script>
</body>"

Additionally, do not forget to create a link to the CSS stylesheet you created in this project's folder. Of course, that will need to go before the close of the head tag at the top of the document. That should look something like this:

"...
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css">
</head>"

NOTE: If you wish to include any special font-styles or icons, those stylesheets will need to be included between these head tags as well.

    A. Let's start to add some bones to this skeleton. A key for a modal is to add something to trigger the pop-up. In my case, I've used a simple, little button. I've given it a class name of 'clickme,' and it includes the message to the user that says "Join our mailing list!" (Not obnoxious at all). Mine looks something like this:

    "<button class = "clickme"> Join our mailing list!</button>"

    B. I've included another button, but this is optional. In the wild, we might see this as a 'Cancel' option or something. My poor users have no such luck! My second, obnoxious button drives home my point, saying, "You have no choice [to join our mailing list]." Again, same format as the first button. HTML will simply generate a button if you tag something as "button."

    "<button class = "clickme"> You have no choice!</button>"

    C. Now we need to lay the groundwork for our modal. I made a div for mine so I could have more control over styling, including visibility (this will come in handy later). You'll notice that within my primary div, I've made an 'X' button, not unlike what we are used to seeing on the upper left or righthand corner of our windows.
    Finally, I've included yet another div inside my div that houses the text for this little modal.

    "...
    <div class = "modal-container">
      <button class = "close"> X </button>
      <div class = "modal">
        <h2>Hi! This is a modal! Give us your information</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div> "

  (Don't forget to close those divs out)

2) The CSS

Now that we've got the skeleton for our project, we should do a CSS Reset so we can get to some styling. I simply copy and paste what I need from http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/.

The most important thing to do for this project's stylesheet is to create 2 (YES TWO) CSS classes that refer directly to whatever you named your divs in the HTML (for instance, mine was 'modal-container' and 'modal'--very clever, right?). (Remember, 2 classes per div.) The first respective class will have a visibility of none. The second class, will have a visibility of 'visible' and a name extension of sorts called '.showing.' This will come in handy when we get to our jQuery.
Like so:

"...

.modal-container{
  visibility: hidden;

}

.modal-container.showing{  <-- See what we did here?
  visibility: visible;
  border: solid 9px #c0c0c0;
  max-width: 300px;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.modal{
  visibility: hidden;
}

.modal.showing{
  visibility: visible;
  width: 250px;
  font-family: arial;
  font-weight: 300px;
  color: black;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;

}"

Beyond the showing and not showing bits, you can pretty much style these however you'd like to. Mine is styled to look particularly ugly upon opening, the way modals tend to.

3) The jQuery (AKA Where the Magic Happens)

So remember how you just made those two CSS classes, showing and not showing,for your divs? We'll need those in a second.

First, the Event Listener.
Basically what this does is tell the browser to "listen" for a click. And not just any old click, our browser is going to listen for a click on the button we made in our HTML. I named mine 'clickme,' remember? That's why '.clickme' is between those first parentheses. A lot of this is just syntax, so as long as you can remember where your named elements go and why, you'll be good to go. For example, ".on('click'...)" is a tool built in to jQuery that allows us to tell the browser to listen for that click. It's kind of just a matter of knowing when and how to use those built in tools.

 "$('.clickme').on('click', function(){"

 "$(this)..." Is another one of those built in tools. It helps the browser target what was just clicked. So the .clickme can be referred to as "$(this)..." for the rest of this function.

  "$(this).text('Sign up, fool!');" //Upon clicking, this is what the button text changes to. It's a nice little touch.

Next, this is where we tell the jQuery to bring up those '.showing' classes. It's pretty much as simple as it sounds. Name the classes you wish to "addClass" to, then ta-da!

  "$('.modal-container, .modal').addClass('showing');
});" //Don't forget to include syntax for closing our your function.


Now, as much as I enjoyed being obnoxious with this modal. We will go ahead and give our users a way to close the pop-up out. Create another event listener on the parts of the modal that our lovely users can click in order to close it. I've chosen by little 'X' button along with the border around the modal (because it's kind of intuitive to click around a pop-up window to close out of it). So exactly like we added classes, we will taketh away. Instead of addClass, we, that's right, you guessed it, remove the class (.removeClass). What a time to be alive.

"$('.close, .modal-container').on('click', function(){
  $('.modal-container, .modal').removeClass('showing');
});"

With all of these steps executed, we now have an obnoxious pop-up demanding users for information. Yay! If you want to take it even further, you can add a form to your HTML so your modal can actually receive customer input.

That concludes this tutorial. Tune in next time, when I hopefully have some kind of grasp on other applications of jQuery and JavaScript...
