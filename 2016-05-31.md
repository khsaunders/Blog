Pair Programming

Pair Programming is when two programmers sit down at the same station and create stuff together. More specifically, one person "drives" while the other watches to offer insight or feedback, helping the driver "navigate." The pair swap roles over the course of their programming session.

Although Wikipedia notoriously only scratches the surface of topics, it informed me that there are three kinds of pair programming, and each are based on the level of the programming pair's level of expertise. They are:
1) Expert-Expert
2) Expert-Novice
3) Novice-Novice

All three sound like an interesting way for people to learn from one another. I am particularly intrigued to see how this would work in our class setting because even though some students catch on to certain topics faster than others, we are all still pretty inexperienced. I suppose we would just be two novices clumsily working our way through head-scratching JavaScript.

One perceived benefit is the support paired programmers can offer one another. Sometimes solving a problem begins with a simple affirmation or the shared experience of being completely clueless and freaked out by a daunting problem.

Personally, I think I will most benefit from pair programming by having somebody to help me ask the right questions. My biggest road blocks come from not being able to articulate what I'm having an issue with, so I will sit there and try to Google it on my own (until it's 3:30 in the morning and I still have no idea what I'm doing).
