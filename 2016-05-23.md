The Growth Mindset

I’ve heard about both a Growth Mindset and a Fixed Mindset before. One claims a person is born with a set number of skills and proclivities, while the other contends people can develop abilities over time. Recognizing each mindset is important because, among other things, they shape self-concept and intrapersonal communication on a regular basis.

I began subconsciously struggling with the symptoms of Fixed Mindset Syndrome (totally a real thing that I didn’t just make up) around the age of 10. I performed well in school and was often praised for how generally “smart” I was, and that resulted in the build up of a lot of pressure. Around that time, math assignments were starting to get a little trickier for me and that really freaked me out because I was “naturally smart” and wasn’t used to struggling in school. I was, as Dr. Dweck described in her TED Talk, gripped with the fear of making mistakes; I wasn’t wrapping my head around the “yet.”

This went on for years until the summer of my junior year in college. I took a 3-D design class and felt completely out of my depth in the woodshop portion of the course. I hadn’t used a table saw or a planer before, and I certainly hadn’t cut lumber at an angle to fashion joints either. I could draw the things that I was thinking, but I had to conceptualize them three-dimensionally, then decide how to make it a reality. In feeling completely out of my element, something I can only describe as purely magical happened:

I realized I had the ability to learn new things.

It was like all of the algebra and geometry (and even some physics) my teachers had tried to instill over the years came flooding into practical applications and were suddenly much more interesting and easy to comprehend.

Was that 3-D design class *challenging?* Yes. But I gave myself permission to not know things and was, in turn, able to better understand them. The best part of that process was that our teacher did the same. He encouraged us to ask questions and was only really a stickler about our safety (because power tools), and after years of feeling like I had to be good at everything I did, I was suddenly free to make mistakes.

So far, my experience at The Iron Yard reminds me of that design class in many ways. Sometimes, it feels scary and, other times, I’m reminded of things I grew up learning about. I can see a lot room for learning, but that means making mistakes and existing beyond my comfort zone.

*I’m still working on fully adapting a Growth Mindset. The word “challenge” has, like, oddly negative connotations for me, but I hope someday I will greet it with joy.
