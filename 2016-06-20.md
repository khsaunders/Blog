#Blog Entry 5

20 June, 2016

For this week's blog, I have been asked to talk about something that I didn't know existed before attending The Iron Yard. Honestly, before the pre-work, I really had no idea how JavaScript worked. Like I still kind of don't, but I at least understand some of the different ways that it interacts with an HTML document. Specifically, it blows my mind that pieces of HTML and CSS documents can be called out and used as an ingredient in a JavaScript function or variable. For as efficient and logical as JS is, it can feel so abstract and foreign. Something as simple as telling a computer to keep track of clicks can feel weirdly monumental.
Furthermore, jQuery was something I hadn't even heard of before researching The Iron Yard. I feel like using it instead of vanilla JS is a little more straight forward, but I still have so much to learn before I even come close to feeling proficient in it (...so I should be good by, like, next week).

One challenge I encounter regularly is how to absorb the amount of information necessary to succeed in such a short amount of time. I can only hope that the things making little sense to me now are being stored away in my brain, slowly taking root and readying themselves for harvest at a later date. Something that only exacerbates the fast pace is comparing myself to my classmates. Fortunately, one of my friends (who actually graduated from TIY just last week) reminded me that comparing myself to others in this kind of work environment is "toxic." If I'm caught up in how much better everybody is than I am, it will be much easier to miss information. I have to except the pace at which I learn (even if it's infuriating).

Something that helps me stay encouraged is setting a timer when I work. If I can walk away from an assignment knowing that I put in X-amount of focused time outside of class, then my failure isn't the result of poor work ethic. Additionally, I think it helps to be mindful the big picture. 12 weeks is a small amount of time; it's the continued learning process and the ways in which I apply my newly acquired skills beyond The Iron Yard that matter most.
