Another Tutorial!

Hi, friends. Last week, I posted a tutorial about making modals with the magic of jQuery. jQuery, in case you don't remember, is a library that overlays JavaScript to make it a little more manageable. From my experience, jQuery makes it possible to accomplish twice as much work in half the time when compared to vanilla JavaScript.

Speaking of accomplishing more in less time, this week's tutorial demonstrates how to add or take away CSS classes all within your jQuery.

First and foremost, you will need your HTML. The example used here is for actually a modal from another project I'm working on.

My HTML looks like so:
```
<div class = "addBookmarkWrapper">
  <button class = "closeAddNew"><i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>
  <div><input class = "newInfoInput" placeholder = "title"></input></span></div>
  <div><input class = "newInfoInput" placeholder = "URL"></input></div>
  <div><input class = "newInfoInput" placeholder = "description"></input></span></div>
<button id = "addBookmarkSubmit"> add bookmark </button>
</div>
```

The important part to focus on here is the name of my modal's container: "addBookmarkWrapper." This element and everything inside is supposed to appear when a button is clicked. Instead of making two CSS classes ("addBookmarkWrapper" and "addBookmarkWrapper.showing"), I simply make one class and enter the "display" as "none."

NOTE: The rest of the styling between those curly braces is what I want that div to look like when it is triggered.

---

Here's the corresponding jQuery for this:

```
$('.addNewBookmark').click(function() {
    $('.addBookmarkWrapper').css('display', 'block');
});
```
When the button with the class "addNewBookmark" is clicked, jQuery tells CSS to change that display that was automatically set to "none" to "block."

This is a really simple feat, but when I learned that I could have been doing this the whole time and cut down on the clutter in my stylesheet, I was pretty excited.

Anyway, there you have it: yet another way jQuery makes cool stuff easy to do.

Thanks, jQuery!
